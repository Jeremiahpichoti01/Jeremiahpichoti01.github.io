Web Valnerabilities and common entry points for attackers. In this topic I will explore **Security Misconfiguration**  and **Cryptographic Failures**
## Security Misconfiguration
It is caused by systems, applications or servers being installed with insecure default settings, unnecessary services being enabled or inappropriate permissions. These are exposed administration panels, open ports, default passwords, detailed error messages and the lack of security headers. With these weaknesses, attackers can use them to obtain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or sensitive information without necessarily having to use advanced methods.


##Cryptographic Failures
Occurs when sensitive information is not well secured based on robust and contemporary cryptographic measures. This can be by employing weak or olden day algorithms, poor key control, plaintext transmission of data or absence of encryption of sensitive data like passwords and credit cards. The breach of data, identity theft and the loss of user trust are possible as a result of attackers intercepting or accessing the exposed data.
