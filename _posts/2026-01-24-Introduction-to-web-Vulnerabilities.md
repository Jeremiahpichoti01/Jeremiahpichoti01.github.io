Web vulnerabilities are common entry points for attackers, I'm going to explore **sql-injection** and **xss** -- two of OWASP top 10.

## SQL injection
Occurs when unsanitized inputs is used in database queries.

## xss
Cross-site scripting allows attackers to inject scripts into web pages viewed by others.
